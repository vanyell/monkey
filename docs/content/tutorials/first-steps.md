In this tutorial, we will setup a simple sandbox environment that will be
useful in future tutorials. We will learn how to access the Infection Monkey's
command and control server and register a new user.

{{% notice info %}}
This tutorial will help you set up an Infection Monkey server and environment
that allows you to complete the remaining tutorials. The Infection Monkey
server that you set up using these steps may have been modified to foster
learning and exploration; is not intended for use in production environments.
After you've completed the tutorials and are ready to install Infection Monkey
in your environment, you can visit the [setup page](../setup/) for instructions
on installing an official release.

### Prerequisites
First, make sure that you have the following installed:
- `docker` and `docker-compose`

### Run the environment
Next, we'll use `docker compose` to run Infection Monkey along with our
vulnerable container.

1. Download the following compose file:
   [docker-compose.yml](docker/docker-compose.yaml)

2. Then, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file and run the
   following command to start the environment:

   ```
   docker compose up
   ```

Now you should have 3 containers running:
- `monkey-island` - the Infection Monkey server
- `mongo` - database used by Infection Monkey
- `hello` - a vulnerable container

You can confirm this by running
```
$ docker container ls --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
CONTAINER ID   NAMES           STATUS
737b67cc344c   monkey-island   Up 7 seconds
fbd91aacc8ea   mongo           Up 7 seconds
b1c9ac1d3b81   hello           Up 7 seconds
```

{{% notice tip %}}
You can shutdown the sandbox environment when you are finished with it by
running `docker compose down` in the same directory that contains the
`docker-compose.yml` file.
{{% /notice %}}

Now that the environment is running, open a browser to
[https://localhost:5000](https://localhost:5000) to access the Monkey Island
web interface. You may see a warning that looks similar to the one shown below.
For this tutorial, you can safely ignore this warning by clicking _Advanced_
followed by _Proceed to localhost (unsafe)_. ![Self-signed certificate

Since this is the first time you're accessing this Infection
Monkey instance, you'll need to register. Provide a username and password, and
then click _Let's go!_.

After registering, you'll be automatically logged in and taken to the **Getting
Started** page.

🎉 Congratulations 🎉 Your environment is up and running!

### Review
Let's take a moment to review what you've learned:
- You now know how to create a sandbox environment for experimenting with
  Infection Monkey using Docker.
- You've learned how register a user with Infection Monkey.


### Next steps
Now that you have a sandbox environment for experimenting with Infection
Monkey, you can move on to [Tutorial 1: Hello, Monkey](../hello-monkey), where
you'll learn how to configure and use Infection Monkey to exploit a vulnerable
server.

If you'd like to install Infection Monkey on a different platform, you can find
instructions on the [Setup](../../setup) page.
