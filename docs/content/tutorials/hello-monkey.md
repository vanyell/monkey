In this tutorial, we will use Infection Monkey to exploit a simple vulnerability. We will configure Infection Monkey to exploit the vulnerability and target a specific machine, and then run it to observe that it is able to gain access to the machine. You'll learn how to start Infection Monkey, configure it, and run it against a network. Specifically, you'll learn how to:
- Install plugins
- Specify targets for Infection Monkey to exploit in the network
- Tell Infection Monkey what exploits to attempt against machines on the network
- Provide Infection Monkey with credentials that it can use when attempting to exploit machines
- Run the Monkey and observe its progress

### Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you'll need to have the sandbox environment set up.
Follow the steps in [Tutorial 0: First steps](../first-steps) if you have not
done so already.

### Configure the Monkey
Before the Monkey can do anything useful, it needs to be configured. Otherwise,
it won't know what exploits to attempt, or what machine(s) to attempt to
breach. To navigate to the configuration page, select _Configure Monkey_
on the _Getting Started_ page (or select _Configuration_ in the navigation
sidebar).

![Configuration page](../../images/tutorials/hello-monkey/3-configuration-page.jpg)

#### Tell the Monkey which machines to target
For this tutorial, we're going to configure the Monkey to exploit the
vulnerable container within the sandbox environment, which has the hostname
`hello`. In order to tell the Monkey to target that hostname, click the the
**Propagation** tab and then select the **Network analysis** subtab.

{{% notice note %}}
The Infection Monkey will only attempt to breach the machines that you've explicitly configured it to target. This helps to ensure that the Monkey doesn't run amok on your network.
{{% /notice %}}

![Network analysis configuration](../../images/tutorials/hello-monkey/4-network-analysis.jpg)

Then, under the _Scan target list_ section, click the "+" button to add a target to scan. Enter our target hostname, `hello`, into the input field.

![Scan target list in the Network Analysis configuration](../../images/tutorials/hello-monkey/5-scan-target-list.jpg)

Finally, make sure to scroll to the bottom and click **Submit** in order to save the configuration.
You should see a notice indicating that the configuration was submitted successfully.

![Submit button](../../images/tutorials/hello-monkey/6-submit-button.jpg)

Great! The Monkey now knows which machine to target. What happens if we run it? Select **1. Run Monkey** in the navigation sidebar to bring up the Run Monkey page. We'll choose the **From Island** option, which will start the Monkey from the Island machine. Go ahead and do that now.

![Run Monkey page](../../images/tutorials/hello-monkey/7-run-monkey.jpg)

Observe that a check mark appears next to **1. Run Monkey** in the navigation sidebar. This indicates that a Monkey Agent has started.

You can see the Monkey's progress by selecting **2. Infection Map** in the navigation sidebar. This brings up a network view (from the Monkey's perspective). You should see an arrow appear between the `monkey-island` machine and the vulnerable container. If you look at the legend, you'll notice that this indicates that the Monkey scanned the container.

![Network map](../../images/tutorials/hello-monkey/8-map-scanned.jpg)

You should also observe a check mark appear next to both **2. Infection Map** and **3. Security Reports** in the navigation sidebar. This indicates that the assessment has completed. Also note that while the Monkey was able to scan the container, it was not able to exploit it. In fact, if you select the vulnerable container in the **Infection Map** view, you'll see that it _hasn't even attempted_ to exploit it. This is because we haven't configured the Monkey with any exploiters. We'll do that next.

#### Tell the Monkey which exploiters to use
Now we're going to configure the Monkey to use an exploiter. In order to do that, select **Configuration** in the navigation sidebar. Select the **Propagation** tab, and the **Exploiters** subtab. You should see a list of _Enabled exploiters_, which you'll notice, is empty. This is because we haven't installed any exploiters yet. Thankfully, the _Enabled exploiters_ list provides a link to a page where we can download and install exploiter plugins, so let's follow that link and install an exploiter.

![Empty exploiters list](../../images/tutorials/hello-monkey/10-empty-exploiter-list.jpg)

{{% notice note %}}
Infection Monkey does not come with exploiters pre-installed. However, it provides an easy way to download and install them from within the Island web interface.
{{% /notice %}}

You should now be at the **Plugins** page. Under the _Available Plugins_ tab you'll see a list of all the plugins that can be installed. Infection Monkey has several types of plugins. Since we're interested in installing an exploiter, let's filter this list to only show us exploiters. Select the _Type_ dropdown, and choose **Exploiter**. You should now see that the _Type_ column only has Exploiter.

For this tutorial we're going to install the _SSH Exploiter_. Type `ssh` into the search field, and you should see an exploiter named **SSH**. Click the download button to install that exploiter. The button will change into a loading indicator to show that it's installing, and then to a check mark when the plugin is installed. You can go to the _Installed Plugins_ tab and see that a plugin named **SSH** of type **Exploiter** is installed.

![Filtered plugin list](../../images/tutorials/hello-monkey/11-filtered-plugin-list.jpg)

Great! We've installed the SSH Exploiter, but we still need to tell the Monkey to use it. Navigate back to the **Configuration** page, and notice that the _Enabled exploiters_ list now shows _SSH Exploiter_ as an option. Check the box next to _SSH Exploiter_, leave the default option values unchanged, and then **Submit** the configuration.

![Enable the SSH Exploiter](../../images/tutorials/hello-monkey/12-exploiter-enabled.jpg)


We've told Infection Monkey which exploiter to use, but we've still got one more step: the SSH Exploiter requires credentials in order to run, and we haven't provided any. Let's do that now.

{{% notice note %}}
Brute force exploiters, such as the SSH Exploiter, require credentials in order to run.
{{% /notice %}}


#### Tell the Monkey which credentials to use
From the **Configuration** page, select the **Propagation** tab, then the **Credentials** subtab.

Enter `user` into the **Identity** field, and `password` in the **Password** field, and hit the _Save_ button.

![Credentials entered](../../images/tutorials/hello-monkey/13-credentials-input.jpg)

You should see a new entry appear in the _Saved Credentials_ list:

![Credentials saved](../../images/tutorials/hello-monkey/14-saved-credentials.jpg)

Make sure you **Submit** the configuration so that the credentials are saved.

Okay, let's give it one more go. Navigate to the _Run Monkey_ page, and run the Monkey **From Island**. Then, switch to the _Infection Map_ and observe the Monkey's progress:

![Network map](../../images/tutorials/hello-monkey/15-map-exploited.jpg)

Huzzah! We've succeeded!

Notice how the arrow from the `monkey-island` to the vulnerable container changed to red? That indicates that Infection Monkey successfully exploited the container. The check mark on the container means that the Monkey Agent was executed in the container, and the gray arrow from the container to the Island indicates that the Monkey Agent reported back to the Island.


### Review
Let's take a moment to review what you've learned:
- You now know that the Monkey does not come with exploiters out of the box, but they can be installed easily. You also know how to get to the Plugins page and install plugins.
- You've learned how to tell the Monkey which machines to target, which exploiters to use, as well as how to provide credentials to the Monkey.
- You've learned how to run the Monkey and observe its progress.


### Next steps
Now that you're more familiar with Infection Monkey, you might try the following:

- Try to secure the vulnerable machine and run the Monkey to verify that your changes work as expected
- Explore some of the other configuration options
- Simulate a network breach on a specific machine by [running the Monkey manually](../../usage/running-manually)
- Explore some of the other Exploiter plugins
- Try using the Monkey to [simulate a ransomware attack](../ransomware)
