The Infection Monkey can be configured to [simulate a ransomware
attack](/features/ransomware-simulation) on your network. After running,
it generates a **Ransomware Report** that provides you with insight into how
ransomware might behave within your environment.

The report is split into three sections:

- [Breach](#breach)
- [Lateral Movement](#lateral-movement)
- [Attack](#attack)

## Breach

The breach section shows when and where the ransomware infection began.

## Lateral movement

The lateral movement section provides information about how the simulated
ransomware was able to propagate through your network.

## Attack

The attack section shows the details of what the simulated ransomware
successfully encrypted, including a list of specific files.
