## Apache Hadoop

[Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) is a widely-used framework for
distributed storage and processing of large data sets. Hadoop YARN is a
component of the Hadoop ecosystem which is used for job scheduling/monitoring
and cluster resource management.

## Exploitation

Hadoop servers having default settings and YARN are susceptible to RCE (remote
code execution) attacks. The [Hadoop YARN ResourceManager REST API](
https://apache.github.io/hadoop/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/WebServicesIntro.html
) allows submitting a new application with launch context, meaning a command
can be provided to be executed once the application is submitted successfully.
By default, Hadoop YARN opens the RPC service to the public, giving attackers
the ability to execute arbitrary commands and control the target server.

Infection Monkey's Hadoop exploiter works by submitting a new application to
YARN. This application's launch context includes a custom command to download
and execute the Agent on the compromised machine.

## Mitigation

1. Hadoop recommends [updating security related settings appropriately](
https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SecureMode.html#Configuration
) — particularly in this case, enabling Kerberos
authentication.

1. Allow only trusted connections to the Hadoop RPC service port.
