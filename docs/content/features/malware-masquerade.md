## Description
**Masquerade** - to assume the appearance of something one is not
[[1](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/masquerade)]

A common way of detecting and identifying an executable as malware is to write
a detection rule (such as for a tool like YARA) that checks for the existence
of strings or unique byte sequences within a file. The Malware Masquerade
feature allows users to specify strings or arbitrary data (bytes) that will be
injected into the Agent binaries. This enables Infection Monkey Agents to
masquerade as specific types of malware. This is particularly useful for anyone
who writes their own detection rules and needs a way to test them, or anyone
looking to improve the fidelity of malware simulations.

## Using Malware Masquerade

### Configuring Strings

It is common for malware detection rules to rely on strings of text present
within a malware binary to identify the malware. Infection Monkey allows you to
specify any number of strings to include within the Linux or Windows Agent
binaries. It's as simple as adding these strings to either list in the
**Masquerade** tab on the **Configuration** screen and clicking _Submit_. You
can verify the success of this operation by downloading the binary and using
the Linux [\`strings\` command.](https://linux.die.net/man/1/strings)


```bash
curl https://<SERVER_IP>:5000/api/agent-binaries/linux -k -o monkey-linux-64 && strings monkey-linux-64 | grep <MY_STRING>
```
